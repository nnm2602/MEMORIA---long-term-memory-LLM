All my life I\u2019ve been a patsy. For as long as I\ncan recall, I\u2019ve been an easy mark for the pitches of peddlers, fund-\nraisers, and operators of one sort or another. True, only some of these\npeople have had dishonorable motives. The others\u2014representatives of\ncertain charitable agencies, for instance\u2014have had the best of intentions.\nNo matter. With personally disquieting frequency, I have always found\nmyself in possession of unwanted magazine subscriptions or tickets to\nthe sanitation workers\u2019 ball. Probably this long-standing status as\nsucker accounts for my interest in the study of compliance: Just what\nare the factors that cause one person to say yes to another person? And\nwhich techniques most effectively use these factors to bring about such\ncompliance? I wondered why it is that a request stated in a certain way\nwill be rejected, while a request that asks for the same favor in a slightly\ndifferent fashion will be successful.\nSo in my role as aThis book is dedicated to Chris,\nwho glows in his father\u2019s eye", "nextNodes": null, "id": 3}, {"content": "n experimental social psychologist, I began to do\nresearch into the psychology of compliance. At first the research", "nextNodes": null, "id": 4}, {"content": "took the form of experiments performed, for the most part, in my\nlaboratory and on college students. I wanted to find out which psycho-\nlogical principles influence the tendency to comply with a request. Right\nnow, psychologists know quite a bit about these principles\u2014what they\nare and how they work. I have characterized such principles as weapons\nof influence and will report on some of the most important in the up-\ncoming chapters.\nAfter a time, though, I began to realize that the experimental work,\nwhile necessary, wasn\u2019t enough. It didn\u2019t allow me to judge the import-\nance of the principles in the world beyond the psychology building and\nthe campus where I was examining them. It became clear that if I was\nto understand fully the psychol\u00f2gy of compliance, I would need to\nbroaden my scope of investigation. I would need to look to the compli-\nance professionals\u2014the people who had been using the principles on\nme all my life.

Their business is to make us comply,\nand their livelihoods depend on it. Those who don\u2019t know how to get\npeople to say yes soon fall away; those who do, stay and flourish.\nOf course, the compliance professionals aren\u2019t the only ones who\nknow about and use these principles to help them get their way. We\nall employ them and fall victim to them, to some degree, in our daily\ninteractions with neighbors, friends, lovers, and offspring. But the\ncompliance practitioners have much more than the vague and amateur-\nish understanding of what works than the rest of us have. As I thought\nabout it, I knew that they represented the richest vein of information\nabout compliance available to me. For nearly three years, then, I com-\nbined my experimental studies with a decidedly more entertaining\nprogram of systematic immersion into the world of compliance profes-\nsionals\u2014sales operators, fund-raisers, recruiters, advertisers, and others.\nThe purpose was to observe, from the insid", "nextNodes": null, "id": 6}, {"content": "e, the techniques and\nstrategies most commonly and effectively used by a broad range of\ncompliance practitioners. That program of observation sometimes took\nthe form of interviews with the practitioners themselves and sometimes\nwith the natural enemies (for example, police buncosquad officers,\nconsumer agencies) of certain of the practitioners. At other times it in-\nvolved an intensive examination of the written materials by which\ncompliance techniques are passed down from one generation to anoth-\ner\u2014sales manuals and the like.\nMost frequently, though, it has taken the form of participant observa-\ntion.

First, we now know more about the influence\nprocess than before. The study of persuasion, compliance, and change\nhas advanced, and the pages that follow have been adapted to reflect\nthat progress. In addition to an overall update of the material, I have\nincluded a new feature that was stimulated by the responses of prior\nreaders.\nThat new feature highlights the experiences of individuals who have\nread Influence, recognized how one of the principles worked on (or for)\nthem in a particular instance, and wrote to me describing the event.\nTheir descriptions, which appear in the Reader\u2019s Reports at the end of\neach chapter, illustrate how easily and frequently we can fall victim to\nthe pull of the influence process in our everyday lives.\nI wish to thank the following individuals who\u2014either directly or\nthrough their course instructors\u2014contributed the Reader\u2019s Reports\nused in this edition: Pat Bobbs, MarThis book is dedicated to Chris,\nwho glows in his father\u2019s eye", "nextNodes": null, "id": 8}, {"content": "k Hastings, James Michaels, Paul\nR.

So when I wanted to learn about\nthe compliance tactics of encyclopedia (or vacuum-cleaner, or portrait-\nphotography, or dance-lesson) sales organizations, I would answer a\nnewspaper ad for sales trainees and have them teach me their methods.\nUsing similar but not identical approaches, I was able to penetrate ad-\nvertising, public-relations, and fund-raising agencies to examine their\ntechniques. Much of the evidence presented in this book, then, comes\nfrom my experience posing as a compliance professional, or aspiring\nprofessional, in a large variety of organizations dedicated to getting us\nto say yes.\nOne aspect of what I learned in this three-year period of participant\nobservation was most instructive. Although there are thousands of\ndifferent tactics that compliance practitioners employ to produce yes,\nthe majority fall within six basic categories. Each of these categories is\ngoverned by a fundamental psychological principle that directs human\nThis book is dedicated to Chris,\nwho glows in his father\u2019s eye", "nextNodes": null, "id": 10}, {"content": "behavior and, in so doing, gives the tactics their power. The book is\norganized around these six principles, one to a chapter. The prin-\nciples\u2014consistency, reciprocation, social proof, authority, liking, and\nscarcity\u2014are each discussed in terms of their function in the society\nand in terms of how their enormous force can be commissioned by a\ncompliance professional who deftly incorporates them into requests\nfor purchases, donations, concessions, votes, assent, etc. It is worthy of\nnote that I have not included among the six principles the simple rule\nof material self-interest\u2014that people want to get the most and pay the\nleast for their choices. This omission does not stem from any perception\non my part that the desire to maximize benefits and minimize costs is\nunimportant in driving our decisions. Nor does it come from any\nevidence I have that compliance professionals ignore the power of this\nrule. Quite the opposite: In my investigations, I frequently saw practi-\ntioners use (sometim", "nextNodes": null, "id": 11}, {"content": "es honestly, sometimes not) the compelling \u201cI can\ngive you a good deal\u201d approach. I choose not to treat the material self-\ninterest rule separately in this book because I see it as a motivational\ngiven, as a goes-without-saying factor that deserves acknowledgment\nbut not extensive description.\nFinally, each principle is examined as to its ability to produce a distinct\nkind of automatic, mindless compliance from people, that is, a willing-\nness to say yes without thinking first. The evidence suggests that the\never-accelerating pace and informational crush of modern life will make\nthis particular form of unthinking compliance more and more prevalent\nin the future. It will be increasingly important for the society, therefore,\nto understand the how and why of automatic influence.\nIt has been some time since the first edition of Influence was published.Robert B.
