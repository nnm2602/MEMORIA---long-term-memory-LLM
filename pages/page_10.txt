WEAPONS OF
INFLUENCE
Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not sim-
pler.
—ALBERT EINSTEIN
IGOT A PHONE CALL ONE DAY FROM A FRIEND WHO HAD RECENTLY
opened an Indian jewelry store in Arizona. She was giddy with a
curious piece of news. Something fascinating had just happened, and
she thought that, as a psychologist, I might be able to explain it to her.
The story involved a certain allotment of turquoise jewelry she had
been having trouble selling. It was the peak of the tourist season, the
store was unusually full of customers, the turquoise pieces were of good
quality for the prices she was asking; yet they had not sold. My friend
had attempted a couple of standard sales tricks to get them moving.
She tried calling attention to them by shifting their location to a more
central display area; no luck. She even told her sales staff to “push” the
items hard, again without success.
Finally, the night before leaving on an out-of-town buying trip, she
scribbled an exasperated note to her head saleswoman, “Everything in
this display case, price × ½,” hoping just to be rid of the offending pieces,
even if at a loss. When she returned a few days later, she was not sur-
prised to find that every article had been sold. She was shocked, though,
to discover that, because the employee had read the “½” in her scrawled
message as a “2,” the entire allotment had sold out at twice the original
price!
