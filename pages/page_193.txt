In addition, there is a unique, secondary source of power within the
scarcity principle: As opportunities become less available, we lose
freedoms; and we hate to lose the freedoms we already have. This desire

the human response to diminishing personal control. According to the
theory, whenever free choice is limited or threatened, the need to retain
our freedoms makes us desire them (as well as the goods and services
associated with them) significantly more than previously. So when in-
creasing scarcity—or anything else—interferes with our prior access to
some item, we will react against the interference by wanting and trying
to possess the item more than before.4
