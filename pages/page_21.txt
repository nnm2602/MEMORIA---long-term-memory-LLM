weeks in the hospital and now I can see almost normally and
only get those sick headaches once a day. Fortunately, the
fire in the dormitory, and my jump, was witnessed by an at-
tendant at the gas station near the dorm, and he was the one
who called the Fire Department and the ambulance. He also
visited me in the hospital and since I had nowhere to live
because of the burntout dormitory, he was kind enough to
invite me to share his apartment with him. It’s really a base-
ment room, but it’s kind of cute. He is a very fine boy and
we have fallen deeply in love and are planning to get married.
We haven’t got the exact date yet, but it will be before my
pregnancy begins to show.
Yes, Mother and Dad, I am pregnant. I know how much
you are looking forward to being grandparents and I know
you will welcome the baby and give it the same love and
devotion and tender care you gave me when I was a child.
The reason for the delay in our marriage is that my boyfriend
has a minor infection which prevents us from passing our
pre-marital blood tests and I carelessly caught it from him.
Now that I have brought you up to date, I want to tell you
that there was no dormitory fire, I did not have a concussion
or skull fracture, I was not in the hospital, I am not pregnant,
I am not engaged, I am not infected, and there is no boyfriend.
However, I am getting a “D” in American History, and an
“F” in Chemistry and I want you to see those marks in their
proper perspective.
Your loving daughter,
Sharon
Sharon may be failing chemistry, but she gets an “A” in psychology.12 / Influence
