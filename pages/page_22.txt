RECIPROCATION
The Old Give and Take…and Take
Pay every debt, as if God wrote the bill.
—RALPH WALDO EMERSON
AFEW YEARS AGO, A UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR TRIED A LITTLE experi-
ment. He sent Christmas cards to a sample of perfect strangers.
Although he expected some reaction, the response he received was
amazing—holiday cards addressed to him came pouring back from the
people who had never met nor heard of him. The great majority of those
who returned a card never inquired into the identity of the unknown
professor. They received his holiday greeting card, click, and, whirr,
they automatically sent one in return. While small in scope, this study
nicely shows the action of one of the most potent of the weapons of in-
fluence around us—the rule for reciprocation.1 The rule says that we
should try to repay, in kind, what another person has provided us. If
a woman does us a favor, we should do her one in return; if a man
sends us a birthday present, we should remember his birthday with a
gift of our own; if a couple invites us to a party, we should be sure to
invite them to one of ours. By virtue of the reciprocity rule, then, we
are obligated to the future repayment of favors, gifts, invitations, and
the like. So typical is it for indebtedness to accompany the receipt of
such things that a term like “much obliged” has become a synonym for
“thank you,” not only in the English language but in others as well.
The impressive aspect of the rule for reciprocation and the sense of
obligation that goes with it is its pervasiveness in human culture. It is
so widespread that after intensive study, sociologists such as Alvin
