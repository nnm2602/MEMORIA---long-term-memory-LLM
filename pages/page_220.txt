CHAPTER 1 (PAGES 1–16)
1. Honest, this animal researcher’s name is Fox. See his 1974 mono-
graph for a complete description of the turkey and polecat experiment.
2. Sources for the robin and bluethroat information are Lack (1943)
and Peiponen (1960), respectively.
3. Although several important similarities exist between this kind of
automatic responding in humans and lower animals, there are some
important differences as well. The automatic behavior sequences of
humans tend to be learned rather than inborn, more flexible than the
lock-step patterns of the lower animals, and responsive to a larger
number of triggers.
4. Perhaps the common “because…just because” response of children
asked to explain their behavior can be traced to their shrewd recognition
of the unusual amount of power adults appear to assign to the raw
word because.
The reader who wishes to find a more systematic treatment of Langer’s
Xerox study and her conceptualization of it can do so in Langer (1989).
5. Sources for the Photuris and the blenny information are Lloyd (1965)
and Eibl-Eibesfeldt (1958), respectively. As exploitative as these creatures
seem, they are topped in this respect by an insect known as the rove
beetle. By using a variety of triggers involving smell and touch, the rove
beetles get two species of ants to protect, groom, and feed them as larvae
and to harbor them for the winter as adults. Responding mechanically
to the beetles’ trick trigger features, the ants treat the beetles as though
they were fellow ants. Inside the ant nests, the beetles respond to their
hosts’ hospitality by eating ant eggs and young, yet they are never
harmed (Hölldobler, 1971).
6. These studies are reported by Kenrick and Gutierres (1980), who
warn that the unrealistically attractive people portrayed in the popular
media (for example, actors, actresses, models) may cause us to be less
