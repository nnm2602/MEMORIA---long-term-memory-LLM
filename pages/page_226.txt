Police theorized she may have been sitting or standing by a
fountain in the Art Institute’s south plaza when she was attacked.
The assailant apparently then dragged her into the bushes. She
apparently was sexually assaulted, police said.
Police said thousands of persons must have passed the site and
one man told them he heard a scream about 2 P.M. but did not in-
vestigate because no one else seemed to be paying attention.
9. The New York “seizure” and “smoke” emergency studies are re-
ported by Darley and Latané (1968) and Latané and Darley (1968), re-
spectively. The Toronto experiment was performed by Ross (1971). The
Florida studies were published by Clark and Word in 1972 and 1974.
10. See a study by Latané and Rodin (1969) showing that groups of
strangers help less in an emergency than groups of acquaintances.
11. The wallet study was conducted by Hornstein et al. (1968), the
antismoking study by Murray et al. (1984), and the dental anxiety study
by Melamed et al. (1978).
12. The sources of these statistics are articles by Phillips in 1979 and
1980.
13. The newspaper story data are reported by Phillips (1974), while
the TV story data come from Bollen and Phillips (1982), Gould and
Schaffer (1986), Phillips and Carstensen (1986), and Schmidtke and
Hafner (1988).
14. These new data appear in Phillips (1983).
15. The quote is from The International Cyclopedia of Music and Musi-

1. The Canadian election study was reported by Efran and Patterson
(1976). Data of this sort give credence to the claim of some Richard
Nixon backers that the failure that contributed most to the loss of the
1960 TV debates with John F. Kennedy—and thereby to the elec-
tion—was the poor performance of Nixon’s makeup man.
2. See Mack and Rainey (1990).
3. This finding—that attractive defendants, even when they are found
guilty, are less likely to be sentenced to prison—helps explain one of
the more fascinating experiments in criminology I have heard of (Kur-
tzburg et al., 1968). Some New York City jail inmates with facial disfig-
urements were given plastic surgery while incarcerated; others with
similar disfigurements were not. Furthermore, some of each of these
two groups of criminals were given services (for example, counselingRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 217
