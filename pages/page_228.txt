own in school comes from Gerard and Miller (1975). The evidence for
the dislike of things repeatedly presented under unpleasant conditions
comes from such studies as Burgess and Sales (1971), Zajonc et al. (1974),
and Swap (1977).
15. From Aronson (1975).
16. A fascinating description of the entire boys’-camp project, called
the “Robbers’ Cave Experiment,” can be found in Sherif et al. (1961).
17. The Carlos example comes once again from Aronson’s initial report
in his 1975 article. However, additional reports by Aronson and by
others have shown similarly encouraging results. A representative list
would include Johnson and Johnson (1983), DeVries and Slavin (1978),
Cook (1990), and Aronson, Bridgeman, and Geffner (1978a, b).
18. For a careful examination of the possible pitfalls of cooperative
learning approaches, see Rosenfield and Stephan (1981).
19. In truth, little in the way of combat takes place when the salesman
enters the manager’s office under such circumstances. Often, because
the salesman knows exactly the price below which he cannot go, he
and the boss don’t even speak. In one car dealership I infiltrated while
researching this book, it was common for a salesman to have a soft
drink or cigarette in silence while the boss continued working at his
desk. After a seemly time, the salesman would loosen his tie and return
to his customers, looking weary but carrying the deal he had just
“hammered out” for them—the same deal he had in mind before enter-
ing the boss’s office.
20. For experimental evidence of the validity of Shakespeare’s obser-
vation, see Manis et al. (1974).
21. A review of research supporting this statement is provided by
Lott and Lott (1965).
22. See the study by Miller et al. (1966) for evidence.
23. The study was done by Smith and Engel (1968).
24. The rights to such associations don’t come cheaply. Corporate
sponsors spend millions to secure Olympic sponsorships, and they
spend many millions more to advertise their connections to the event.
Yet it may all be worth the expense. An Advertising Age survey found
that one third of all consumers said they would be more likely to pur-
chase a product if it were linked to the Olympics.
25. The Georgia study was done by Rosen and Tesser (1970).
26. From Asimov (1975).
27. Both the sweatshirt and the pronoun experiments are reported
fully in Cialdini et al. (1976).Robert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 219
