In the interim, some things have happened that I feel deserve a place
in this new edition. First, we now know more about the influence
process than before. The study of persuasion, compliance, and change
has advanced, and the pages that follow have been adapted to reflect
that progress. In addition to an overall update of the material, I have
included a new feature that was stimulated by the responses of prior
readers.
That new feature highlights the experiences of individuals who have
read Influence, recognized how one of the principles worked on (or for)
them in a particular instance, and wrote to me describing the event.
Their descriptions, which appear in the Reader’s Reports at the end of
each chapter, illustrate how easily and frequently we can fall victim to
the pull of the influence process in our everyday lives.
I wish to thank the following individuals who—either directly or
through their course instructors—contributed the Reader’s Reports
used in this edition: Pat Bobbs, Mark Hastings, James Michaels, Paul
R. Nail, Alan J. Resnik, Daryl Retzlaff, Dan Swift, and Karla Vasks. In
addition, I would like to invite new readers to submit similar reports
for possible publication in a future edition. They may be sent to me at
the Department of Psychology, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ
85287-1104.
