The economic growth was funded through a\nvariety of activities, the principal and still most visible of which is the\nrequest for donations by Society members from passersby in public\nplaces.

The average Amer-\nican considered the Krishnas weird, to say the least, and was reluctant\nto provide money to support them. It quickly became clear to the Society\nthat it had a considerable public-relations problem. The people being\nasked for contributions did not like the way the members looked,\ndressed, or acted. Had the Society been an ordinary commercial organ-\nization, the solution would have been simple\u2014change the things the\npublic does not like.

They switched to a fund-raising\ntactic that made it unnecessary for target persons to have positive feel-\nings toward the fund-raisers. They began to employ a donation-request\nprocedure that engaged the rule for reciprocation, which, as demon-\nstrated by the Regan study, is strong enough to overcome the factor of\ndislike for the requester.

The obligation to receive reduces our ability to choose whom\nwe wish to be indebted to and puts that power in the hands of others.\nLet\u2019s reexamine a pair of earlier examples to get a sense of how the\nprocess works. First, let\u2019s return to the Regan study, where we find that\nthe favor causing subjects to double the number of raffle tickets pur-\nchased from Joe was not one they had requested. Joe had voluntarily\nleft the room and returned with one Coke for himself and one for the\nsubject. There was not a single subject who refused the Coke.

Of course, one could say that the subject had the choice\nof saying no to both of Joe\u2019s offers. But those would have been tough\nchoices. To have said no at either point would have required the subject\nto go against the natural cultural forces favoring reciprocation arrange-\nments that Jujitsu Joe had aligned himself with.\nThe extent to which even an unwanted favor, once received, can\nproduce indebtedness is aptly illustrated in the soliciting technique of\nthe Hare Krishna Society.

Thus the alarming climb in crash\nfatalities we find following front-page suicides is, according to Dr.\nPhillips, most likely due to the Werther effect secretly applied.\nI consider this insight brilliant. First, it explains all of the data beauti-\nfully. If these wrecks really are hidden instances of imitative suicide, it\nmakes sense that we should see an increase in the wrecks after suicide\nstories appear. And it makes sense that the greatest rise in wrecks should\noccur after the suicide stories that have been most widely publicizeini Ph.D / 23", "nextNodes": null, "id": 86}, {"content": "d\nand have, consequently, reached the most people. And it makes sense\nthat the number of crashes should jump appreciably only in those\ngeographical areas where the suicide stories were publicized. And it\neven makes sense that single-victim suicides should lead only to single-\nvictim crashes, whereas multiple-victim suicide incidents should lead\nonly to multiple-victim crashes. Imitation is the key.\nBut there is a second valuable feature of Phillips\u2019s insight. Not only\ndoes it allow us to explain the existing facts, it also allows us to predict\nnew facts that had never been uncovered before. For example, if the\nabnormally frequent crashes following publicized suicides are genuinely\ndue to imitative rather than accidental actions, they should be more\ndeadly as a result. That is, people trying to kill themselves will likely\narrange (with a foot on the accelerator instead of the brake, with the\nnose of the plane down instead of up) for the impact to be as lethal as\npossible. The consequenc", "nextNodes": null, "id": 87}, {"content": "e should be quick and sure death. When\nPhillips examined the records to check on this prediction, he found that\nthe average number of people killed in a fatal crash of a commercial\nairliner is more than three times greater if the crash happened one week\nafter a front-page suicide story than if it happened one week before. A\nsimilar phenomenon can be found in traffic statistics, where there is\nevidence for the deadly efficiency of postsuicide-story auto crashes.\nVictims of fatal car wrecks that follow front-page suicide stories die\nfour times more quickly than normal.\nStill another fascinating prediction flows from Phillips\u2019s idea. If the\nincrease in wrecks following suicide stories truly represents a set of\ncopycat deaths, then the imitators should be most likely to copy the\nsuicides of people who are similar to them.

The rule demands that one sort of action be reciprocated\nwith a similar sort of action. A favor is to be met with another favor; it\nis not to be met with neglect, and certainly not with attack. But within\nthe similar-action boundaries, considerable flexibility is allowed. A\nsmall initial favor can produce a sense of obligation to agree to a sub-\nstantially larger return favor.

What\u2019s more, the question\nimpels us to distinguish between relevant authorities and irrelevant\nauthorities. And this is a distinction that is easy to forget when the push\nof authority pressure is combined with the rush of modern life.

It is the conduct of such\npeople that gives us the greatest insight into what constitutes correct\nbehavior for ourselves. Therefore we are more inclined to follow the\nlead of a similar individual than a dissimilar one.\nThat is why I believe we are seeing an increasing number of average-\nperson-on-the-street testimonials on TV these days.

An especially apt illustration can be found in a study done\nseveral years ago by Columbia University psychologists. The researchers\nplaced wallets on the ground in various locations around midtown\nManhattan to observe what would happen when they were found.
