You are tasked with dividing a book into different parts that relate to each other in some way. You will be given a list of summaries of different section of the book and your task is to tell me which grouping is logical and the overall idea of each group in 1 sentence. Each section will be listed out in chronological order so it's preferable if you can come up with a grouping that group sections closer together as one. Answer in the following format:
[sectionA,sectionB,sectionC,...,title] 
for example:
[1,2,3,4,"overview of human behavior"],[5,6,"what extinction is"]
means that you group 1,2,3,4 into a group that's called "overview of human behavior" and 5 and 6 into a group that's called "what extinction is". 

Here's are the summaries of different section:
